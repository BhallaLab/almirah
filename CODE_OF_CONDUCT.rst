Code of Conduct
===============

Each of us as a member of the community will ensure that all
contributors and users enjoy their time here and feel
welcome. Accordingly, everyone participating in the development or
usage of *almirah* in any way possible will display kindness, show
respect, gracefully accept constructive feedback, responsibly report
data security issues and generously help other community members
including end-users seeking guidance.

We also encourage everyone, regardless of age, gender identity, level
of experience, language, race or religion to be involved in the
project. We pledge to make participation in the community a
harassment-free experience for everyone.

Our standards
-------------

We commit to promote any behavior that contributes to create a
positive environment including:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful.
- Showing empathy towards everybody.
- Respecting data privacy standards.  
- Focusing on what is best for the community.  

We do **NOT** tolerate harassment or inappropriate behavior of any
kind.

Our responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within our online GitHub repository
and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or
its community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting Upi Bhalla at bhalla@ncbs.res.in. This
includes disclosure of security risks or leaks in datasets and
disrespect of data privacy.

Confidentiality will be respected in reporting.

The community leaders can take any action deemed appropriate for the
safety of the community, including but not limited to:

- facilitating a conversation between the two parties involved in the
  violation of the code of conduct.
- requesting a contributor apologize for their behavior.
- asking a contributor or multiple contributors to enter a cooling off
  period that puts a time-limited pause on a particular discussion
  topic or access to a dataset.
- asking a contributor to no longer participate in the development or
  usage of *almirah*.
