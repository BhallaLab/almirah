Examples Gallery
================

The examples gallery is a collection of working code samples
demonstrating simple analysis and visualization using the CALM-BRAINS
dataset. The examples lack a narrative explanation but are
well-commented to make the code self-explanatory. These examples are a
way to get familiar with using `almirah`_ and the CALM-BRAINS dataset,
discover analysis possibilities, or plotting ideas.
