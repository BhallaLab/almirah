Mental illnesses include well-recognized conditions such as
schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, addiction and
dementia. Changes in the structure and function of the brain that
result in mental illness are poorly understood. Neither do we
understand why some individuals are more prone to developing mental
illness than others. Understanding these underlying changes in the
brain will likely lead to better methods to diagnose and treat mental
illness.

The CALM-BRAINS dataset hopes to aid in answering these questions. It
consists of data collected at-risk families along multiple
modalities - MRI, EEG, fNIRS, Eye tracking, Cognition, Genetics, and
Clinical assessments. This document describes these modalities and the
tasks.

This document will be updated periodically and have release-specific
tables that provide an overview on the data available.
