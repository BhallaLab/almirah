   changelog

almirah aids in the organization, maintenance, and usage of both
file-based and table-based datasets. Developed to handle neuroimaging
datasets, it provides data format conversion support for specific
modalities.

Out-of-the-box, almirah supports:

- BIDS specification for neuroimaging datasets.
- BIDS-like specification for genome sequence data.
- Interfacing with databases supported by SQLAlchemy.
- File format conversion for neuorimaging data.
- Lazy access of DataLad compatible datasets.

With some time on config writing, almirah can:

- Organize unformatted datasets.
- Query and filter across the dataset.
- Migrate records from one database to another.

Installing
----------

almirah can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
		
		$ python -m pip install almirah

Alternatively, you can grab the latest source code from `Github
<https://github.com/girishmm/almirah>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

		$ git clone https://github.com/girishmm/almirah.git
		$ cd almirah
		$ pip install .

Usage
-----

The :doc:`user-guide` is the place to go to learn how to use the
libray and accomplish common dataset related tasks. If you have the
time, we recommend following the :doc:`tutorial` for a complete
overview.

almirah relies heavily on configs to guide its tasks. The
:doc:`writing-configs/index` page describes the possibilities in
detail.

If you want to access the ADBS dataset, please head over to
:doc:`adbs/tutorial` for a walk-through. The
:doc:`adbs/reference/index` documentation provides details on the
files and records available in the dataset. If you have not heard of
the ADBS study, but would like to know, :doc:`adbs/index` page can
help acquaint you.

The :doc:`reference/index` documentation provides API-level
documentation.

Can you use almirah to manage your dataset? Of course. Have a look at
:ref:`translate` section for files to tweak to achieve this.

Who uses almirah?
--------------

almirah was primarily developed to support and maintain the data
generated by the ADBS study. But we believe it can aid with other
datasets too! Even non-neuroimaging ones!

If almirah was able to help with your dataset, we would love to hear
about it.

.. _translate:

Translate to another dataset
----------------------------

If your dataset is a BIDS dataset, congrats you are done! ðŸŽ‰

If you dataset follows a different specification, describe it as a
config file by referring to :doc:`writing-configs/specification`. This
should allow filtering and querying of the dataset.

If you would like to organize data according to a described
specification, define rules according to :doc:`writing-configs/rules`.

If you need assistance migrating records from one database to another,
or one schema to another, :doc:`writing-configs/mapping` can guide
you.

Help and Support
----------------

We try to make almirah robust, but there might be things we missed. If it
does not meet your use case or you have trouble adapting it to your
dataset, please `write to us <girishmm@ncbs.res.in>`_ or open an issue
on the `repository <https://github.com/girishmm/almirah>`_ or drop by
`Github Discussions <https://github.com/girishmm/almirah/discussions>`_.

Citing
------

If you use almirah to help with your dataset, please consider citing this
repository until a journal article is specifically available for almirah.

If you use the ADBS dataset in your research, please cite the
