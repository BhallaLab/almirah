Dataset Reference
=================

Mental illnesses include well-recognized conditions such as
schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, addiction and
dementia. Changes in the structure and function of the brain that
result in mental illness are poorly understood. Neither do we
understand why some individuals are more prone to developing mental
illness than others. Understanding these underlying changes in the
brain will likely lead to better methods to diagnose and treat mental
illness.

The Accelerator program for Discovery in Brain disorders using Stem
cells (ADBS) is a new scientific venture to understand mental illness
by harnessing the power of sophisticated clinical investigations,
modern human genetics, and stem cell technology. In this effort, data
is collected from at-risk families along multiple modalities - MRI,
EEG, fNIRS, Eye tracking, Cognition, Genetics, and Clinical
assessments. This document describes these modalities and the tasks.

This document will be updated based on the latest dataset release.
